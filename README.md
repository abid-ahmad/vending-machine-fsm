# 🎯 Vending Machine FSM – Verilog HDL (Honors College Project)

A **Finite State Machine (FSM)** vending machine designed in **Verilog HDL**, supporting incremental coin inputs, multiple product prices, combo purchase logic, and **real hardware testing** on the **Nexys A7 FPGA board**.  
Developed as part of my **Honors College independent project** at **Wayne State University**.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights
- Built a **fully custom FSM** from scratch for the honors upgrade.
- Expanded from a 2-product design to **3 products**:
  - 🍬 Candy – $0.25  
  - 🥤 Soda – $0.50  
  - 🍟 Chips – $0.75
- Implemented **combo logic** allowing bundled purchases at $0.75.
- Integrated **LED indicators** for coin progress and dispensing states.
- Verified functionality through **simulation** and **FPGA hardware deployment**.

---

## 🛠 Features
- FSM architecture using **Enable-Based Next State FSM (EBNFSM)**.
- Coin recognition in **$0.25 increments**: $0.25 → $0.50 → $0.75.
- Idle and reset handling for robust operation.
- Clean, modular Verilog implementation for maintainability.
- **Testbench included** for simulation verification.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 🖥 Simulation (Vivado)
1. **Download the full project ZIP**:
   - [📦 vending_machine_fsm_full_project.zip](code/vending_machine_fsm_full_project.zip)
2. **Extract the ZIP**:
   - Windows: Right-click → "Extract All"
   - macOS: Double-click to unzip
3. Open the `.xpr` file in **Vivado**.
4. Run **Behavioral Simulation** directly.
5. View the waveform to verify correct FSM behavior — no manual file adding is required.

---

### ⚡ FPGA Deployment
1. **Download and extract** the same ZIP file as above.
2. Open the `.xpr` file in **Vivado**.
3. Click **Generate Bitstream** ⚙️.
4. Connect the **Nexys A7 board** via USB.
5. Click **Program Device** → Select generated `.bit` file.

---

### 🛠 Troubleshooting
- ❌ **Bitstream fails to generate?**
  - Ensure FPGA drivers are installed and the board is detected.
- ❌ **Display not working?**
  - Check that the 7-seg wiring matches the included constraints file.
- ❌ **FSM stuck in one state?**
  - Press the reset button and confirm pushbutton inputs are functional.
